My debt to you my beloved
is one i cannot pay
in any coin of any realm
on any reckoning day
for where is he who shall
figure the debt when all is said
to one who made you dream again
when all the dreams were dead
or where is the appraiser
who shall the claim compute
of one who makes you sing again
who makes you sing
who makes you sing again
when all the songs were mute
