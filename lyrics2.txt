#Words are flowing out
#like endless rain into a paper cup
#They slither while they pass
#They slip away across the universe
#Pools of sorrow waves of joy
#are drifting through my open mind
#Possessing and caressing me
#Jai guru deva om
#Nothing’s gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Images of broken light
#which dance before me
#like a million eyes
#That call me on and on across the universe
#Thoughts meander like a
#restless wind inside a letter box
#they tumble blindly as
#they make their way across the universe
#Jai guru deva om
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth
are ringing through my open ears
exciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which
shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
#Jai guru deva om
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Nothing's gonna change my world
#Jai guru deva
#Jai guru deva
